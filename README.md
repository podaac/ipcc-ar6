IPCC AR6 sea-level change projections used in the code/plots in this repository are available from PO.DAAC at the following links:
* https://archive.podaac.earthdata.nasa.gov/podaac-ops-cumulus-docs/web-misc/IPCC/IPCC_AR6_slp_global.tar.gz (Global)
* https://archive.podaac.earthdata.nasa.gov/podaac-ops-cumulus-docs/web-misc/IPCC/IPCC_AR6_slp_regional.tar.gz (Regional)

Details about the format and content of the files in each tarball can be found in the accompanying documentation ([ReadMe_IPCC_AR6_SL_Projections.pdf](https://archive.podaac.earthdata.nasa.gov/podaac-ops-cumulus-docs/web-misc/IPCC/ReadMe_IPCC_AR6_SL_Projections.pdf)). A brief summary is copied just below.

><u>Overview:</u>    
>The IPCC AR6 sea-level change projection files are provided in a simplified format but represent a more complicated workflow involving combinations of multiple lines of evidence for the various individual contributors to sea-level change. We highly recommend using the data as provided in these confidence-level output files to remain consistent with the assessment in IPCC AR6 Chapter 9.
